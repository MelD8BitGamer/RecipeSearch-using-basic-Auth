//API keys are used for extra security.
/* you only have 5 minutes and it will only accept a certain amount of users to the API
 everyone has their own API key associated to the account. if you so more than 1000 request the n it is going cost you money and they all have limitations per month or request per time. If you do disobey the limitations you will get an error code. So this will give the vendor you usage of the API and who is using it
 if you push your API key you will want to use ignore so that it could IGNORE your API key. If you push it a=then anyone can just goand take your API key causing you to run your API limitations
 also if you make money off the API they are gonna wanna make money from you
